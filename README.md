# hksuperG

The developed code serves as a tool for generating random number combinations with specific constraints, commonly used in betting games or lotteries. This code allows users to input the number of combinations they want to generate, the bet values for four-digit (4D), three-digit (3D), and two-digit (2D) combinations, as well as a list of four-digit combinations that should be excluded from the results. The code comprises several key components, including the initialization of global variables for digit names and number limits, the `generate_kombinasi` function to generate valid random number combinations, and the `main` function to handle user input and display the results. During the process, the code ensures that the generated number combinations do not include any of the forbidden combinations and constructs the result strings in the desired format for use in betting games or simulations. Consequently, this code not only assists in generating random number combinations but also provides additional control to avoid specific numbers, making it a flexible and useful tool in the context of number-based betting.

# ANNOUNCEMENT!!

GIT CLONE READY!!

`https://github.com/kingashari/hksuperG`

dead numbers are ready to use again, bugs have been fixed, download version 2.0.3 on release if this is using the version without dead numbers download **RELOAD** version 2.0.2. the git clone folder has been updated, if you have previously saved an update with `git pull` on the repository

**RELOAD** has been release

# update version
about updates can be seen at releases

# coming soon
coming in website to universal useing

1.6 there are changes

2.3 coming soon feature adding totally bet

HONGKONG | SDYNEY | SINGAPORE ready to auto-play numbers in the 2.3 update 


# build
Visual Studio Code

v1.89 april 2024

Python version

Python 3.11.9

# maintenace
If it's not available yet, it means it's still in development mode

bet mode available NOW

totally not available

dead number data is now available automatically in update 1.7

# web version ?

The web version will come, maybe it won't be long in 2-3 weeks, this will probably use the first version, maybe use WAP mode because here we are looking for easy access. I will add some important features first before rolling out the web version. version 1.9? version 2.0 or 2.1? Don't know.

There is no continuation of the web version yet, because there are still many additional features that might be useful, but don't worry, this will be made as soon as possible

if you want to help me develop the website you only contact me in profile :)

# NOTE!!

In the version 1.6 update, we decided to remove a feature that I found to be unnecessary. After careful consideration and thorough research, I have decided to eliminate the dead number feature. This will be replaced with a feature that allows users to eliminate numbers that have already been drawn or that they believe will not be drawn.

in 1.7 if the dead number has an error or can't be run, you can replace it in the Python script, look for the code 
'url = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and contact me, I'll give you a small update

# GUI EDITION NOW AVAILABLE!!
The creation of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) serves to simplify the interaction between the user and the program, particularly in cases where specific tasks such as data scraping and generating number combinations are involved. Previously, the program required users to interact through the terminal or command line, which can be cumbersome for non-technical users. By introducing a GUI, users no longer need to type commands or remember complex syntax. Instead, they can access functionalities via visual elements like buttons, input fields, and labels, making the program much more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.

One of the key advantages of using a GUI is the clear and organized presentation of information. In a terminal, data output is often linear and can be difficult to follow, especially when dealing with long lists or complex results. A GUI allows data to be displayed in structured ways, such as horizontal layouts or within neatly organized labels. This not only improves readability but also enhances the overall experience, as users can view multiple pieces of information at once in a well-ordered format.

The efficiency of interaction is significantly improved through a GUI as well. Functions that would otherwise require manual input or multiple steps in a command-line interface can now be executed with a single click. For example, users can press a "Scrape Data" button to fetch information from a website without needing to understand the underlying web scraping code. Similarly, generating number combinations or copying results like 4D, 3D, and 2D combinations can be done instantly with buttons designed for each task. This seamless interaction makes the program faster and more intuitive.

Beyond ease of use, a GUI enhances the overall user experience by providing immediate feedback and interactivity. For instance, after copying results, the GUI can display a notification confirming that the data has been successfully copied to the clipboard. This type of real-time feedback ensures users feel in control of the process and gives them confidence that their actions are being executed as intended. Such interactive elements make the program more engaging compared to a static command-line interface.

Lastly, a GUI broadens the potential user base. While command-line tools may be favored by more technical users, a GUI makes the program accessible to a wider audience, including those who may not have any programming knowledge. This inclusivity means the program can serve more people, offering them a practical solution for tasks like generating number combinations or performing web scraping without the technical overhead.

In summary, the development of a GUI transforms the program into a more user-friendly, efficient, and visually organized tool. It minimizes the need for technical knowledge, provides a smoother experience, and makes complex operations accessible with simple interactions, ultimately benefiting both novice and advanced users alike.
