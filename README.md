The developed code serves as a tool for generating random number combinations with specific constraints, commonly used in betting games or lotteries. This code allows users to input the number of combinations they want to generate, the bet values for four-digit (4D), three-digit (3D), and two-digit (2D) combinations, as well as a list of four-digit combinations that should be excluded from the results. The code comprises several key components, including the initialization of global variables for digit names and number limits, the `generate_kombinasi` function to generate valid random number combinations, and the `main` function to handle user input and display the results. During the process, the code ensures that the generated number combinations do not include any of the forbidden combinations and constructs the result strings in the desired format for use in betting games or simulations. Consequently, this code not only assists in generating random number combinations but also provides additional control to avoid specific numbers, making it a flexible and useful tool in the context of number-based betting.

totally not available

dead number data is now available automatically in update 1.7

# web version ?

The web version will come, maybe it won't be long in 2-3 weeks, this will probably use the first version, maybe use WAP mode because here we are looking for easy access. I will add some important features first before rolling out the web version. version 1.9? version 2.0 or 2.1? Don't know.

There is no continuation of the web version yet, because there are still many additional features that might be useful, but don't worry, this will be made as soon as possible

# NOTE!!

In the version 1.6 update, we decided to remove a feature that I found to be unnecessary. After careful consideration and thorough research, I have decided to eliminate the dead number feature. This will be replaced with a feature that allows users to eliminate numbers that have already been drawn or that they believe will not be drawn.

in 1.7 if the dead number has an error or can't be run, you can replace it in the Python script, look for the code 
'url = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and contact me, I'll give you a small update
