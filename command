make me a program in Python, this program is used to search for a number randomly, the numbers will come out according to the rules that I made.\
Each digit number has its own name, for example the number 1234
1 THOUSAND is US
2 HUNDRED is KOP
3 TENS is HEAD or KEP for short
4 UNITS are TAILS or EKO for short

Example output:

INPUT DEAD NUMBERS: 1234 (the number 1234 will not come out in a combination of AS, KOP, HEAD AND TAIL)
INPUT HOW MANY COMBINATIONS WILL OUT: 2 (each combination has 6, if 2 the output is 12)

COMBINATION RESULTS: 2345*2356*345*365*45*56*7895*7859*895*859*95*59 (FROM 4 DIGITS TO 2 DIGITS SEPARATE USING ASTEEL SIGN (*))(CAN YOU SEE IN MY COMBINATION RESULTS ENTER 2 AND IN THE COMBINATION RESULTS 12 RESULTS OUT (NUMBER 1234 ON EACH AS, KOP, KEP, EKO DOES NOT COME OUT, REPLACE THE NUMBERS IF THEY ARE REGISTERED ON THE DEAD NUMBERS 0-9 FOR EXAMPLE IF THE DEAD NUMBERS ON AS 1 THEN THE NUMBER 1 IS REPLACED WITH THE NUMBERS 0-9 OTHER THAN THE NUMBER 1 BECAUSE IT IS DEAD AND APPLIED TO ALL MEMBERS, AS, KOP, KEP, EKO)
4D BET: 300 (Bet to separate each digit into digits with a fence, after the fence and the total bet (300) and separated with a + sign and continued with the next digit for example 2345*2356#300+345*365#400+45*56# 500)
3D BET: 400 (Bet to separate each digit into digits with a fence, after the fence and total bet (400) and separated with a + sign and continued with the next digit for example 2345*2356#300+345*365#400+45*56# 500)
2D BET: 500 (Bet to separate each digit into digits with a fence, after the fence and total bet (500) and separated with a + sign and continued with the next digit for example 2345*2356#300+345*365#400+45*56# 500)

FINAL RESULT : 2345*2356#300+345*365#400+45*56+7895*7859#300+895*859#300+95*59#500
